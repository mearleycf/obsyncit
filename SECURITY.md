## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ObsyncIt seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Security Design

ObsyncIt follows these security principles:

1. **File Safety**
   - Validates file operations
   - Checks permissions
   - Uses safe file handling

2. **Data Protection**
   - Creates backups before operations
   - Validates JSON content
   - Protects against malformed input

3. **Error Containment**
   - Isolates failures
   - Prevents cascading errors
   - Maintains data integrity

4. **Access Control**
   - Respects file permissions
   - Validates paths
   - Contains operations to vault directories

## Security Considerations

### File Operations

- All file operations are validated
- Paths are normalized and checked
- Permissions are verified
- Backups are created before modifications

### Data Validation

- JSON content is validated
- Schema checking is enforced
- Input sanitization is performed
- Type safety is maintained

### Error Handling

- Errors are contained
- Operations are atomic where possible
- Recovery procedures are provided
- Logging captures security events

## Secure Development

### Code Review Process

All code changes undergo security review focusing on:

1. Input validation
2. File operation safety
3. Error handling
4. Data validation
5. Type safety

### Testing Requirements

Security-related code must have:

1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. Edge case coverage
4. Error condition testing

## Secure Installation

### Verification

Always verify:

1. Package integrity
2. Source authenticity
3. Dependencies
4. Installation permissions

### Configuration

Secure configuration includes:

1. Proper file permissions
2. Limited directory access
3. Safe backup locations
4. Appropriate logging levels

## Updates and Patches

Security updates will be released as:

1. Patch versions for bug fixes
2. Minor versions for non-breaking improvements
3. Major versions for breaking changes
